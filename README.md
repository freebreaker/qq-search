# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and was used to search QQ data.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Data Source

We'll be using api based on https://api.uomg.com/doc-qq.info.html

## Requirements

- `Realize the input QQ number to query the basic information of QQ instantly (only enter the legitimate QQ number)`

- `Query the QQ avatar, QQ nickname and QQ number (see the renderings) correctly`

- `Query error display error prompt (style free play)`

- `There needs to be a request status prompt (e.g. loading, the style is free to play)`


## Notes on project

- `You need to use typescript`

- `You can not use third party UI libraries`

- `You can use a library of lightweight tools such as Axios, Lodash, etc`

- `You need to think about how to do it better and more carefully (think about what you usually consider when you do projects), but also be careful not to overthink`

- `If you need to use third-party components, you must use third-party components with elegance`

- `Keep the code clean`
